/**
 * Execution thrown to stop any further rule execution along a rule axis. When
 * this exception is thrown, no further axis binding takes place, and the
 * execution process ends.  This is true whether a condition column or an
 * n-cube cell throws this exception.  What cells have been process, will be returned,
 * and all changes made (to the output Map) will be kept to this point.
 *
 * This exception only kills of one 'stack frame'.  So if an n-cube calls another
 * n-cube, and the called n-cube throws a rule stop, only the inner n-cubes
 * execution is ended.  The execution is returned to the outer (calling) n-cube
 * and picks up as it normally does on a call (join) to another n-cube.
